                    <p id="p1">Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis,
                        an evergreen shrub native to Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.
                        There are many different types of tea; some teas, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,
                        while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.
                    </p >
                    <p id="p2">
                        Tea originated in Southwest China, where it was used as a medicinal drink. It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty,
                        and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century.

            <h3>Green Tea</h3>
            <p>
                The ancient Chinese society first encountered the tea plant in what is now southern China and processed it as another medicinal herb for use
                in Chinese herbology. The processing technique used to process fresh tea leaves was to immediately steam the fresh tea leaves and dry them for
                preservation, which is likely the most ancient Chinese form of tea leaf processing. This processing method was perfected near the end of the
                Han Dynasty and produced a dried tea that would be classified today as "green tea" and quite similar to modern Japanese sencha.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the increase of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried
                after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into
                brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature
                tea leaves were preferred for tea production. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="blackblock" class="item textslide">
            <h3>Black Tea</h3>
            <p>
                The technique for producing black tea was first developed during the late Ming Dynasty Wuyishan,
                Fujian either resulting from the over-oxidation of tea-leaves during the manufacture of oolong tea
                or indirectly from the methods of manufacturing green and white teas.
                In the early 1600s, tea producers in the Wuyi Mountains began kneading the sun-withered tea leaves to macerate them,
                then allowed them to dry under the sun, thus reaching full oxidation and producing "Gongfu" black tea.
                When there was insufficient sun and temperatures were low, the withered leaves would be processed indoors
                in warmed rooms and allowed to fully oxidize, then smoked dry over pine fires thus producing lapsang souchong.
            </p>

        <div id="oolongblock" class="item textslide">
            <h3>Oolong Tea</h3>
            <p>
                The Qing Dynasty was also the period when oolong tea was first developed in the Fujian province.
                It was originally produced in thin brick form, known then under then name "Beiyuan" tea.
                The importance of the withering process for producing oolong tea was described by poet Huang Furen in his poem,
                which indicated that the processing of tea leaves is not a simple task, requiring the scaling of steep cliffs to pick the choicest leaves
                and the withering of the leaves under the sun and warm winds.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tea's oxidation is stopped somewhere between the standards for green tea and black tea.
                The processing typically takes two to three days from withering to drying[8] with a relatively short oxidation period of several hours.
